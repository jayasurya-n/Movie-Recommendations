# Movie-Recommendations

## Content based filtering

A toy algorithm was implemented for content based filtering just to showcase the principle on which content based filtering works on. 

The algoithm:
<ol>
  <li>Ask user to rate 3 random movies from the whole dataset</li>
  <li>Assign weight to each genre based on the movie ratings given by the user</li>
  <li>Based on weightage of genres sample movies from the movie dataset </li>
</ol> 


## Colaborative based filtering

### Matrix factorization model

The input data is split into Train and Test data. Train data is given input to the Matrix Factorisation technique in which SVD ++ Algorithm is used, ratings are computed corresponding to the test data using the ratings of the trained data. From the algorithm we get complete user-item matrix of the data, and rmse value of the ratings for the test data is computed which is around 1.18. 


### Neural collaborative model

The model was proposed in the paper 
```
He, Xiangnan, et al. "Neural collaborative filtering." Proceedings of the 26th international conference on world wide web. 2017.
```

#### Architecture

<img src="assets/arch.png">

The proposed architecture has two branches, the branchesâ€™ outputs are concatenated and sent through an MLP layer. One of the branches generalises the MF model, and the other branch models the complex user-item function through MLP layers. The embeddings used in both these branches are different to allow more flexibility.
